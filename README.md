osu!droid is a free-to-play circle clicking rhythm game for Android devices. It was a game hatched many years ago by the [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) community. This project is now being developed by a small group of fans and also with the help of foreign friends.

## Status

osu!droid is still work-in-progress. Some features are going to be implemented in the future but it's still playable and fun!

### Downloading the source code

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/osudroid/osu-droid.git
```
Open the folder in Android Studio.

To update the source code to the latest commit, run the following command inside the osu-droid directory:

```she
git pull
```
Coding Languages:

You can code for the project in `Java` or `Kotlin`.

### Building

In Android Studio you can `Build` a debug release to test your changes. The output directory of your `.apk` is inside `build/output` of osu-droid's directory.

Or if you prefer the command line and you are on Linux, run `chmod +x gradlew` and `./gradlew assembleDebug` inside the directory to build the debug `.apk` files but make sure that you are using Java 8.
