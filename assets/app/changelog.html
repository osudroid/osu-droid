# Changes

- Rework mod storage system <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Reco1I](https://github.com/Reco1I) and [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Allows for more mods and more expansive mod capabilities, some of them have been demonstrated via the new mods that
    have been added alongside this release!
- Redesign mod menu user interface <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Reco1I](https://github.com/Reco1I) and [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - With the addition of many more mods, the current mod menu became too cluttered and could not handle them. As such,
    it has been redesigned to also account for the overall theme of other interfaces.
- Replace speed modify with Custom Speed mod <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - As a part of the mod storage system rework, speed modify is now considered an actual mod.
  - Mod icon is skinnable with `selection-mod-customspeed`.
- Replace forced difficulty statistics with Difficulty Adjust mod <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - As a part of the mod storage system rework, forced difficulty statistics are now considered an actual mod.
  - Mod icon is skinnable with `selection-mod-difficultyadjust`.
- Redesign gameplay loading screen <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Reco1I](https://github.com/Reco1I)</span>
  - Now displays epilepsy warning. 
  - Now includes settings that were removed from the current mod menu, plus additional ones such as beatmap-specific
    offset.
- Unify hit object scaling equation <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Previously, the scaling of hit objects was inconsistent as it was influenced by the height of the device. This means
    that under osu!pixels measurement, a hit object may have had a bigger size in some devices compared to others.
  - Now, the scaling of hit objects is consistent across all devices with respect to osu!pixels measurement.
  - **This means that circle sizes change in all devices. However, the change has been made to match the new circle sizes
    to the current ones as close as possible**.
  - To ensure proper playback and difficulty calculation of replays to this date, a new system mod called "Replay V6"
    has been added to restore the old scaling equation. This mod cannot be picked by players and is only available for
    replays.
- Partially match stacking behavior with osu!stable <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - The previous stacking behavior was wrong for a multitude of reasons, namely:
    - It does not stack sliders
    - It is based on the delta time of two objects instead of approach rate, the factor that actually affects
      readability
    - Stacking can still apply even when two objects are not in the same position
  - More importantly, or perhaps the primary driving factor of this change, is because stack offset calculation depends
    on the device's screen resolution.
  - These have now been fixed.
  - Like the previous change, the new Replay V6 mod restores the old stacking behavior.
- Bump osu!droid skill multipliers <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Increases star rating and performance points of all beatmaps to account for hit object stacking and scale changes.
- Exclude some accessibility services from accessibility detection <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Some system services could not be disabled, but they would prevent the player from playing.
  - Current excluded services are:
    - `com.android.systemui`
    - `com.miui.voiceassist`
- Ensure that HUD editor only uses Autoplay mod <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Reduce maximum cursor count in gameplay from 10 to 3 <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Only allow slider tracking state to be retained by the cursor that activated the tracking state <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This prevents a slider's tracking state from being dependent on all cursor, which is not expected.
- Replace "restart game" button with "quit game" upon game crash <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This prevented crash analytics from working.
