# Additions

- Add beatmap attribute display <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Can be displayed by pressing the text with difficulty values (CS, AR, OD, HP, star rating) in song select.
- Add option for selecting language in settings <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Can be accessed under the `General` category in settings.
  - Changing the language requires restarting the game. Therefore, it is disabled in multiplayer.
- Add ability to search mods and mod presets in mod menu <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>

# Changes

- Do not update OD value when using Precise mod in song select <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - It's the hit window that is different, not the OD, so attempting to "pair" OD like this is conceptually wrong.
- Rework input handling in gameplay <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This solves an issue where inputs between two frames (commonly known as subframe inputs) are discarded except the
    last input before the next frame (an input is either a finger press, finger drag, or finger lift).
  - Makes hitobject judgements "consume" finger presses sequentially. This means that if there are `n` hitobjects with
    the same starting time, and they overlap, they would require `n` presses to hit instead of one (there is a
    [beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1157609#osu/2439789) that abuses this behavior).
- Numerous optimizations to difficulty calculation <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - May not be noticeable, but should be better regardless. Maybe the improvement is noticeable in gameplay loading if real-time pp counter is enabled.
- Localization updates <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by community contributors</span>

## osu!droid Star Rating and Performance Points Changes

A newspost containing more details about these changes will be published after they are applied to global ranking.

- Replace existing visual skill with a better implemented reading skill <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - This is a port of [this](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/33196) change with but modified to fit osu!droid's gameplay
    environment and existing system.
  - Notable adjustments:
    - Reduced high AR difficulty since approach circle starts at 3x scale instead of 4x
    - Partial slider reading difficulty assessment from visual skill is kept with some changes to constants for balancing
    - Rhythm is accounted for via rhythm difficulty calculation
    - Miss penalty additionally accounts for a proportion-based miss penalty to account for cheesing
    - Accuracy scaling uses estimated unstable rate (lower OD gives a harsher scaling) instead of accuracy percentage
- Adjust angle bonuses in aim to balance very difficult aim scores gaining a lot of pp from reading skill <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Cap vibro tapping difficulty delta time at 300 1/4 BPM interval <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Scores with note intervals higher than said interval will receive more pp, provided that they are above a certain estimated unstable rate.

# Bug Fixes

- Fix potential crash when canceling gameplay loading while slider paths are being loaded <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix non-host players being able to change required mods' settings in free mod <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix score overflow when playing a beatmap with information that has not been fully populated <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - Full population happens in background difficulty calculation. This bug happens when a player plays a beatmap with
    the ScoreV2 mod enabled and with the beatmap not being calculated yet.
- Fix replay import notifications not showing <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix Really Easy mod approach rate adjustment only counting Custom Speed mod instead of all constant rate-changing mods <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix wrong displayed score when opening it from pp-based beatmap leaderboard if the score is different from the score-based leaderboard <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix room host being able to clear ScoreV2 mod in multiplayer <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix incorrect overall difficulty in Relax osu!droid performance calculation <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix show scoreboard setting potentially only taking effect after restarting gameplay <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
- Fix beatmap reimport (e.g., redownloading a beatmap in beatmap downloader) not working due to import redundancy checks <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>

# Removals

- Remove `Remove slider lock and spinner lock` setting <span style="font-size: 0.75em">by [Rian8337](https://github.com/Rian8337)</span>
  - With the rework to gameplay input handling, this is enabled by default and thus is no longer needed.
